# DataHaven Well-Being Analysis and Shiny App

R Markdown source for producing an analysis of raw survey data for [DataHaven](http://www.ctdatahaven.org/about.php), a New Haven-based non-profit dedicated to improving quality of life in the Greater New Haven area by collecting, sharing, and interpreting public data for effective decision making. 

The analysis uses lasso feature selection to develop ordinal and binomial logistic regression models predictive of well-being, as measured by survey responses about overall satisfaction, health, and job satisfaction.

Although the original survey data cannot be uploaded for privacy reasons, the final report is included in this repository, and the prototype [Shiny web app](https://langelgjm.shinyapps.io/datahaven) is public.
